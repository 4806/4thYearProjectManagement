# 4thYearProjectManagement                   [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/4806/4thYearProjectManagement.svg?token=us4qsxqi7zv1aRoJAiLW&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/4806/4thYearProjectManagement)

Profs can enter 4th year project topics, delete ones they no longer offer, or archive them for later use. For a given 4th year project topic, they can enter a description, program restrictions, and the number of students required. Students can look up projects and apply for one that they like. When a project is full, no more students can apply for it. The 4th year project coordinator can search for students without a project and send them a reminder. For the oral presentations, profs and students enter their availability. The 4th year project coordinator can allocate the oral presentations to rooms based on availability. This can be done manually or using a very simple “best effort” algorithm. For the final project, students submit their reports online by a deadline specified by the 4th year project coordinator and enforced by the system.


## Milestone 1: Early prototype. Give a 10-15 minute demo during the lab March 6
For this milestone we are looking to see enough functionality to get a feel for the system and how it will
work. One important use case should be operational. It should collect data from the back end, do
something with it and display the result. The display doesn't need to be fancy. There should be a GitHub
repo, integrated with Travis CI (or other hosted CI), and the app should be up and running on Heroku.
We will also inspect the README file, the Issues, the Kanban, the code reviews, the tests, and we will
verify that everybody is participating in all aspects of the project (if that is not the case, different team
members will end up with different grades).

### Completed in Milestone 1 : 
 - PM-4: Use Case 1 : User Registration
 - PM-11: Use Case 2 : User Login
 - Use Case 3 : Display a Welcome Page when logged in

## Milestone 2: Alpha Release. Give a 10-15 minute demo during the lab March 20
For the alpha release your system should be somewhat usable, although not feature-complete. This
means that a user should be able to use several related features of the app and do something reasonably
useful. The README on GitHub must be updated with a plan for the next sprint.

## Milestone 3 - Final demo. Project complete. Public demo during the lab April 3
For the final sprint of your project you must decide on the final scope of the product: a set of features
that can be implemented within the given timeline and makes the product usable and useful. The user
interface should not have any dangling links to non-implemented features.
The final demo will tentatively be done on a projector, so be prepared to present to the entire class.
